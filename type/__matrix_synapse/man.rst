  handled by a reverse Proxy such as NGINX.

smtp-host
  The hostname of the outgoing SMTP server to use. Defaults to 'localhost'.

  Password for authentication to the SMTP server. By
  default, no authentication is attempted.

notification-from
  From address to use when sending emails. Defaults
  to "%(app)s <no-reply@$SERVER_NAME>".

message-max-lifetime
  Default retention policy. If set, Synapse will apply it to rooms that lack
  the 'm.room.retention' state event. Ignored if
  enable-message-retention-policy is not set. Defaults to 1y.

web-client-url
  Custom URL for client links within the email
  notifications. By default links will be based on
  "https://matrix.to".

  based on factors such as the number of users in the room. The default is 1.0.

room-encrypt-policy
  Controls whether locally-created rooms should be end-to-end encrypted by
  default. Possible options are "all" (any locally-created room), "invite"
  (any room created with the private_chat or trusted_private_chat room
  creation presets , and "off" (this option will take no effect). Defaults to
  "off".

app-service-config-file
  Path (on remote) of an application service configuration file to load. Can be specified multiple times.

worker-replication-secret
  A shared secret used by the replication APIs to authenticate HTTP requests
  from workers. Ignored if worker-mode is not set. By default this is unused and
  traffic is not authenticated.

background-tasks-worker
  The worker that is used to run background tasks (e.g. cleaning up expired
  data). If not provided this defaults to the main process.

outbound-federation-worker
  Worker to be used for sending federation requests. Can be specified multiple
  times. Disables sending outbound federation requests from the master process.

registration-shared-secret
  If set, allows registration of standard or admin accounts by anyone who
  has the shared secret, even if registration is otherwise disabled.

bind-address
  Address used to bind the synapse listeners. Can be specified multiple times.
  Defaults to '::1' and '127.0.0.1'.

extra-setting
  Arbitrary string to be added to the configuration file. Can be specified multiple times.

BOOLEAN PARAMETERS
------------------
enable-registrations
  Enables user registration on the homeserver.

enable-ldap-auth
  Enables ldap-backed authentication.

ldap-use-starttls
  Use STARTTLS when connection to the LDAP server.

report-stats
  Whether or not to report anonymized homeserver usage statistics.

expose-metrics
  Expose metrics endpoint for Prometheus.

enable-notifications
  Enable mail notifications (see smtp-* optinal parameters).

smtp-use-starttls
  Use STARTTLS when connection to the SMTP server.

disable-federation
  Disable federation to the broader matrix network.

registration-require-email
  Make email a required field on registration.

allow-public-rooms-over-federation
  Allow other homeservers to fetch this server's public room directory.

allow-public-rooms-without-auth
  If set to 'false', requires authentication to access the server's public rooms directory through the client API.

enable-server-notices
  Enable the server notices room.

allow-guest-access
  Allows users to register as guests without a password/email/etc, and
  participate in rooms hosted on this server which have been made accessible
  to anonymous users.

limit-remote-room-complexity
  When this is enabled, the room "complexity" will be checked before a user joins
  a new remote room. If it is above the complexity limit (see
  remote-room-complexity-threshold parameter), the server will disallow
  joining, or will instantly leave.

disable-presence
  Disable presence tracking on this homeserver.

user-directory-search-all-users
  Defines whether to search all users visible to your HS when searching the
  user directory, rather than limiting to users visible in public rooms.
  If you set it True, you'll have to rebuild the user_directory search indexes,
  see
  `<https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/user_directory.md>`_.

enable-message-retention-policy
  If this feature is enabled, Synapse will regularly look for and purge events
  which are older than the room's maximum retention period. Synapse will also
  filter events received over federation so that events that should have been
  purged are ignored and not stored again. See message-max-lifetime flag.

worker-mode
  For small instances it recommended to run Synapse in the default monolith
  mode. For larger instances where performance is a concern it can be helpful
  to split out functionality into multiple separate python processes. These
  processes are called 'workers'. Please read the  WORKER MODE section of this
  manpage before enabling, as extra work and considerations are required.

PERFORMANCE
-----------

The Synapse server is not very performant (initial implementation, pretty
resource hungry, etc.) and will eventually be replaced by Dendrite. The
following parameters (see above descriptions) will help you with performance
tuning:

  * global-cache-factor
  * event-cache-size
  * disable-presence
  * limit-remote-room-complexity and remote-room-complexity-threshold

WORKER MODE
-----------

Worker mode allows to move some processing out of the main synapse process for
horizontal scaling. You are expected to use
:strong:`cdist-type__matrix_synapse_worker`\ (7) to set up workers when the
worker-mode flag is set.

Worker mode depend on the following components:

  * A working `redis <https://redis.io/>`_ server
  * The hiredis python package (`python3-hiredis
    <https://packages.debian.org/buster/python3-hiredis>`_ on debian, not
    packaged in alpine as of 2021-02-17).
  * The txredisapi python package, which is not packaged on debian nor alpine
    as of 2021-02-17.

The current way to install the above two python packages (if not packaged in
your distribution) is sadly to use pip (cf. :strong:`cdist-type__python_pip`\ (7)).

It is also recommended to first take a look at:

  - `upstream's high-level overview on workers (matrix.org blog post) <https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/03/how-we-fixed-synapses-scalability>`_
  - `upstream's documentation on workers <https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/workers.md>`_

EXAMPLES
--------

.. code-block:: sh

    __matrix_synapse --server-name ungleich.ch \
      --base-url https://matrix.ungleich.ch \
      --database-engine sqlite3 \
      --database-name /var/lib/matrix-syanpse/homeserver.db
