cdist-type__mail_alias(7)
=========================

NAME
----
cdist-type__mail_alias - Manage mail aliases.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This type allows you to configure mail aliases (``/etc/aliases``).


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
-------------------
None.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
-------------------
state
    'present' or 'absent', defaults to 'present'
alias
    an alias, i.e. a mail address where mail for the user should be redirected
    to.
    This parameter can be specified multiple times to redirect to multiple
    recipients.
    If ``--state`` is ``present`` this parameter is required.
    See `aliases(5)` for the different forms this parameter can take.


BOOLEAN PARAMETERS
------------------
None.


EXAMPLES
--------

.. code-block:: sh

    # Redirect root mail to a "real" email address
    __mail_alias root --alias admin@example.com

    # Disable redirection of mail for joe
    __mail_alias joe --state absent


BUGS
----
- Quoted strings are not parsed by this type. As a result, aliases
  containing ``,`` (commas) are treated incorrectly (they are treated as
  separate aliases.)
  Make sure that email addresses, file names, and pipe commands do not contain
  commas.
- ``:include:`` directives in the aliases file are not evaluated by this type.
  They are treated like a regular alias, the values of the included file are
  not expanded.
