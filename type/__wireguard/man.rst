cdist-type__wireguard(7)
========================

NAME
----
cdist-type__wireguard - Configure a wireguard interface

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This type creates a wireguard interface named using the `${__object_id}`. It
generates a configuration file for wireguard and a configuration file for
ifconfig, and then brings the interface up.

Additional peers for the created wireguard interface can be added using
`cdist-type__wireguard_peers(7)`.

Currently, this type is only implemented for Alpine Linux.

Currently, this type only supports setting an IPv6 address to assign to the
wireguard interface.

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
-------------------

privkey
  The private key for this wireguard instance.

address
  The IPv6 address to assign to the wireguard interface, optionally with a CIDR
  mask.

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
-------------------

port
  The port to listen on. If not specified, wireguard will choose one randomly.
