cdist-type__bird_function(7)
============================

NAME
----
cdist-type__bird_function - Create a named function to use in configuring bird.


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This type writes a configuration file for the bird internet routing daemon. It
is guaranteed that all functions defined through this type will be loaded
before any other protocol defined using :strong:`cdist-type__bird_xxx`\ (7). However,
note that if two functions have a dependency, they will be loaded in
alphabetical order, so some care may need to be taken in the naming.

This type takes it's input through stdin, expecting a valid function definition
as per the bird configuration file syntax.

EXAMPLES
--------

.. code-block:: sh

    # Setup bird, a function and open a BGP session.
    __bird_core --router-id 198.51.100.4

    require='__bird_core' __bird_function is_device <<- EOF
        function is_device (enum source)
        {
        if (source = RTS_DEVICE) then return true;
        return false;
        }
    EOF
